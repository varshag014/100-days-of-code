Perform the following function. 
def Productsmallpair(sum,arr)

This function accepts the integers sum and arr. It is used to find the arr(j) and arr(k), where k ! = j. arr(j) and arr(k) should be the smallest elements in the array.

Keep this in mind:

If n<2 or empty, return –1.
If these pairs are not found, then return to zero.
Make sure all the values are within the integer range.
 
Example

Input:
Sum: 9
Arr: 5 4 2 3 9 1 7

Output:
2

Explanation

From the array of integers, we have to select the two smallest numbers, i.e 2 and 1. Sum of these two (2 + 1) = 3. This is less than 9 (3 < 9). The product of these two is 2 (2 x 1 = 2) Hence the output is integer 2.

Sample input:
Sum: 4
Arr: 9 8 –7 3 9 3

Sample output:
–21



s=int(input())
arr=list(map(int,input().split()))
arr.sort()
a=arr[0]+arr[1]
if s>a:
    b=arr[0]*arr[1]
    print(b)
